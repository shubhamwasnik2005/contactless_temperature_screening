Components 
RFID RC 522: - RFID module consists of a reader and a information 
               encoded tag when the tag is in proximity of the reader the encoded 
               information is transferred to the reader using radio frequency waves. RFID 
               follows SPI protocol.
               
Ultrasonic ranging module HC - SR04: - Ultrasonic ranging module is 
                               used to detect the distance of object from the sensor in this project it is used 
                               to detect person standing in proximity of temperature sensor.
                                
16*2 LCD display with I2C Interface: - It is used to display the data and it 
                                       uses I2C serial communication.
                                       
Infrared temperature sensor MLX90614: -It is a contact less temperature 
                                       sensor which detect the temperature variation it follows I2C serial 
                                       communication
                                       
                                       
Bluetooth module HC 05: - This module is used to wirelessly communicate 
                          data to computer using Bluetooth this module work on 9600 baud rate.
